For\r\nverification of implementation we will use [Turek](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.550.1689&rep=rep1&type=pdf) as reference. \r\nWe will explore and use the different testcases derived in this paper for comparison of our Fluid, Structure and FSI implementation. \r\nAs an extension we will consider both Arbitrary Lagrangian Eulerian and a fully Eulerian description for the FSI models. \r\n\r\n## Verification of Fluid solver\r\n1. CFD1 : CHECK!\r\n2. CFD2 : CHECK!\r\n3. CFD3 : Minor errors in the Drag Calculations, will be solved after Structure is fully implemented\r\n\r\n## Verification of Structure solver\r\n1.
